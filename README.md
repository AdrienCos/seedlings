# 🌱 Seedlings

This repository holds various project templates, configuration files, and code
fragments that can be used to bootstrap new projects.

Currently, only one template is available, for Python projects.

## 🐍 Python template

To generate a new project based on the Python template, use
[`copier`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and answer the questions
it asks you:

```sh
mkdir my_new_project
copier copy gh:AdrienCos/seedlings my_new_project
# Answer the prompts
cd my_new_project
# Start working!
```
